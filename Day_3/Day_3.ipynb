              "[{'content': '# 🚀 How to Contribute to Letta\\n\\nThank you for investing time in contributing to our project! Here\\'s a guide to get you started.\\n\\n## 1. 🚀 Getting Started\\n\\n### 🍴 Fork the Repository\\n\\nFirst things first, let\\'s get you a personal copy of Letta to play with. Think of it as your very own playground. 🎪\\n\\n1. Head over to the Letta repository on GitHub.\\n2. In the upper-right corner, hit the \\'Fork\\' button.\\n\\n### 🚀 Clone the Repository\\n\\nNow, let\\'s bring your new playground to your local machine.\\n\\n```shell\\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/letta.git\\n```\\n\\n### 🧩 Install dependencies & configure environment\\n\\n#### Install uv and dependencies\\n\\nFirst, install uv using [the official instructions here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\\n\\nOnce uv is installed, navigate to the letta directory and install the Letta project with uv:\\n```shell\\ncd letta\\neval $(uv env activate)\\nuv sync --all-extras\\n```\\n#### Setup PostgreSQL environment (optional)\\n\\nIf you are planning to develop letta connected to PostgreSQL database, you need to take the following actions.\\nIf you are not planning to use PostgreSQL database, you can skip to the step which talks about [running letta](#running-letta-with-uv).\\n\\nAssuming you have a running PostgreSQL instance, first you need to create the user, database and ensure the pgvector\\nextension is ready. Here are sample steps for a case where user and database name is letta and assumes no password is set:\\n\\n```shell\\ncreateuser letta\\ncreatedb letta --owner=letta\\npsql -d letta -c \\'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector\\'\\n```\\nSetup the environment variable to tell letta code to contact PostgreSQL database:\\n```shell\\nexport LETTA_PG_URI=\"postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER:-letta}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-letta}@localhost:5432/${POSTGRES_DB:-letta}\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter this you need to prep the database with initial content. You can use alembic upgrade to populate the initial\\ncontents from template test data.\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic upgrade head\\n```\\n\\n#### Running letta with uv\\n\\nNow when you want to use `letta`, you can use `uv run` to run any letta command:\\n```shell\\nuv run letta run\\n```\\n\\n#### Installing pre-commit\\nWe recommend installing pre-commit to ensure proper formatting during development:\\n```\\nuv run pre-commit install\\nuv run pre-commit run --all-files\\n```\\nIf you don\\'t install pre-commit, you will need to run `uv run black .` before submitting a PR.\\n\\n## 2. 🛠️ Making Changes\\n\\n### 🌟 Create a Branch\\n\\nTime to put on your creative hat and make some magic happen. First, let\\'s create a new branch for your awesome changes. 🧙\\u200d♂️\\n\\n```shell\\ngit checkout -b feature/your-feature\\n```\\n\\n### ✏️ Make your Changes\\n\\nNow, the world is your oyster! Go ahead and craft your fabulous changes. 🎨\\n\\n\\n#### Handling Database Migrations\\nIf you are running Letta for the first time, your database will be automatically be setup. If you are updating Letta, you may need to run migrations. To run migrations, use the following command:\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic upgrade head\\n```\\n\\n#### Creating a new Database Migration\\nIf you have made changes to the database models, you will need to create a new migration. To create a new migration, use the following command:\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"Your migration message here\"\\n```\\n\\nVisit the [Alembic documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for more information on creating and running migrations.\\n\\n## 3. ✅ Testing\\n\\nBefore we hit the \\'Wow, I\\'m Done\\' button, let\\'s make sure everything works as expected. Run tests and make sure the existing ones don\\'t throw a fit. And if needed, create new tests. 🕵️\\n\\n### Run existing tests\\n\\nRunning tests:\\n```\\nuv run pytest -s tests\\n```\\n\\nRunning tests if you installed via pip:\\n```\\npytest -s tests\\n```\\n\\n### Creating new tests\\nIf you added a major feature change, please add new tests in the `tests/` directory.\\n\\n## 4. 🧩 Adding new dependencies\\nIf you need to add a new dependency to Letta, please add the package via `uv add <PACKAGE_NAME>`. This will update the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. If the dependency does not need to be installed by all users, make sure to mark the dependency as optional in the `pyproject.toml` file and if needed, create a new extra under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.\\n\\n## 5. 🚀 Submitting Changes\\n\\n### Check Formatting\\nPlease ensure your code is formatted correctly by running:\\n```\\nuv run black . -l 140\\n```\\n\\n### 🚀 Create a Pull Request\\n\\nYou\\'re almost there! It\\'s time to share your brilliance with the world. 🌍\\n\\n1. Visit [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta).\\n2. Click \"New Pull Request\" button.\\n3. Choose the base branch (`main`) and the compare branch (your feature branch).\\n4. Whip up a catchy title and describe your changes in the description. 🪄\\n\\n## 6. 🔍 Review and Approval\\n\\nThe maintainers will take a look and might suggest some cool upgrades or ask for more details. Once they give the thumbs up, your creation becomes part of Letta!\\n\\n## 7. 📜 Code of Conduct\\n\\nPlease be sure to follow the project\\'s Code of Conduct.\\n\\n## 8. 📫 Contact\\n\\nNeed help or just want to say hi? We\\'re here for you. Reach out through filing an issue on this GitHub repository or message us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9GEQrxmVyE).\\n\\nThanks for making Letta even more fantastic!\\n\\n## WIP - 🐋 Docker Development\\nIf you prefer to keep your resources isolated by developing purely in containers, you can start Letta in development with:\\n```shell\\ndocker compose -f compose.yaml -f development.compose.yml up\\n```\\nThis will volume mount your local codebase and reload the server on file changes.',\n",

              " {'content': '# Step Completion Webhook\\n\\nThis feature allows you to receive webhook notifications whenever an agent step completes in the Letta agent loop.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe webhook service integrates with Letta\\'s execution architecture in two ways:\\n\\n### 1. With Temporal (Recommended)\\n\\nWhen using Temporal for agent workflows, webhook calls are wrapped as Temporal activities, providing:\\n- Built-in retry logic with configurable timeouts\\n- Full observability in Temporal UI\\n- Durability guarantees\\n- Consistent error handling\\n- Activity history and replay capability\\n\\nWebhooks are triggered after the `create_step` activity completes in the Temporal workflow.\\n\\n### 2. Without Temporal (Direct Execution)\\n\\nFor direct agent execution (non-Temporal), webhooks are called directly from the `StepManager` service methods:\\n- `update_step_success_async()` - When step completes successfully\\n- `update_step_error_async()` - When step fails with an error\\n- `update_step_cancelled_async()` - When step is cancelled\\n\\nWebhooks are sent after the step status is committed to the database.\\n\\n### Common Behavior\\n\\nIn **both** cases:\\n- ✅ Webhook failures do not prevent step completion\\n- ✅ Step is always marked as complete in the database first\\n- ✅ Webhook delivery is logged for debugging\\n- ✅ Same authentication and payload format\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nSet the following environment variables to enable webhook notifications:\\n\\n### Required\\n\\n- **`STEP_COMPLETE_WEBHOOK`**: The URL endpoint that will receive POST requests when steps complete.\\n  - Example: `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/step-complete`\\n\\n### Optional\\n\\n- **`STEP_COMPLETE_KEY`**: A secret key used for authentication.\\n  - When set, the webhook service will include this in an `Authorization` header as `Bearer {key}`\\n  - Example: `your-secret-webhook-key-12345`\\n\\n## Webhook Payload\\n\\nWhen a step completes, the webhook service will send a POST request with the following JSON payload:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"step_id\": \"step-01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nIf `STEP_COMPLETE_KEY` is configured, requests will include an Authorization header:\\n\\n```\\nAuthorization: Bearer your-secret-webhook-key-12345\\n```\\n\\nYour webhook endpoint should validate this key to ensure requests are coming from your Letta instance.\\n\\n## Example Webhook Endpoint\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple example of a webhook endpoint (using FastAPI):\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nimport os\\n\\napp = FastAPI()\\n\\nclass StepCompletePayload(BaseModel):\\n    step_id: str\\n\\nWEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv(\"STEP_COMPLETE_KEY\")\\n\\n@app.post(\"/api/webhooks/step-complete\")\\nasync def handle_step_complete(\\n    payload: StepCompletePayload,\\n    authorization: str = Header(None)\\n):\\n    # Validate the webhook key\\n    if WEBHOOK_SECRET:\\n        if not authorization or not authorization.startswith(\"Bearer \"):\\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Missing authorization\")\\n\\n        token = authorization.replace(\"Bearer \", \"\")\\n        if token != WEBHOOK_SECRET:\\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid authorization\")\\n\\n    # Process the step completion\\n    print(f\"Step completed: {payload.step_id}\")\\n\\n    # You can now:\\n    # - Log the step completion\\n    # - Trigger downstream processes\\n    # - Update your application state\\n    # - Send notifications\\n\\n    return {\"status\": \"success\"}\\n```\\n\\n## Usage Example\\n\\n```bash\\n# Set environment variables\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_WEBHOOK=\"https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/step-complete\"\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_KEY=\"your-secret-webhook-key-12345\"\\n\\n# Start your Letta server\\npython -m letta.server\\n```\\n\\n## When Webhooks Are Sent\\n\\nWebhooks are triggered when a step reaches a terminal state:\\n\\n1. **Success** - Step completed successfully (`StepStatus.SUCCESS`)\\n2. **Error** - Step failed with an error (`StepStatus.FAILED`)\\n3. **Cancelled** - Step was cancelled (`StepStatus.CANCELLED`)\\n\\nAll three states trigger the webhook with the same payload containing just the `step_id`.\\n\\n## Behavior\\n\\n- **No webhook URL configured**: The service will skip sending notifications (logged at debug level)\\n- **Webhook call succeeds**: Returns status 200-299, logged at info level\\n- **Webhook timeout**: Returns error, logged at warning level (does not fail the step)\\n- **HTTP error**: Returns non-2xx status, logged at warning level (does not fail the step)\\n- **Other errors**: Logged at error level (does not fail the step)\\n\\n**Important**: Webhook failures do not prevent step completion. The step will be marked as complete in the database regardless of webhook delivery status. This ensures system reliability - your webhook endpoint being down will not block agent execution.\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTo test the webhook functionality:\\n\\n1. Set up a webhook endpoint (you can use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) for testing)\\n2. Configure the environment variables\\n3. Run an agent and observe webhook calls when steps complete\\n\\n```bash\\n# Example using webhook.site\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_WEBHOOK=\"https://webhook.site/your-unique-url\"\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_KEY=\"test-key-123\"\\n\\n# Run tests\\npython -m pytest apps/core/letta/services/webhook_service_test.py -v\\n```\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\nThe webhook notification is sent after:\\n1. The step is persisted to the database\\n2. Step metrics are recorded\\n\\nThis ensures that the step data is fully committed before external systems are notified.\\n\\n### Temporal Integration\\n\\nWhen using Temporal, the webhook call is executed as a separate activity (`send_step_complete_webhook`) with the following configuration:\\n\\n- **Start-to-close timeout**: 15 seconds\\n- **Schedule-to-close timeout**: 30 seconds\\n- **Retry behavior**: Wrapped in try-catch to prevent workflow failure on webhook errors\\n\\nThis allows you to monitor webhook delivery in the Temporal UI and get detailed visibility into any failures.\\n\\n### File Locations\\n\\n**Core Service:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/services/webhook_service.py` - HTTP client for webhook delivery\\n\\n**Temporal Integration:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/agents/temporal/activities/send_webhook.py` - Temporal activity wrapper\\n- `apps/core/letta/agents/temporal/temporal_agent_workflow.py` - Workflow integration\\n- `apps/core/letta/agents/temporal/constants.py` - Timeout constants\\n\\n**Non-Temporal Integration:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/services/step_manager.py` - Direct calls in update_step_* methods\\n\\n**Tests:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/services/webhook_service_test.py` - Unit tests',\n",

As an overview:\\n\\n- When you use Letta applications/services/websites, we collect basic (anonymous) telemetry data such as clicks, crashes, etc.\\n  - This data helps us understand how our users are using the Letta application(s) and it informs our roadmap of future features and buxfixes.\\n  - If you would like to opt-out of basic telemetry, you can modify your configuration file to include `telemetry_disabled = True`.\\n- When you use Letta hosted services (such as the hosted endpoints or Discord Bot), we collect the data that was used to render these services.\\n  - For example, for the hosted endpoint, this includes the message request and message response.\\n  - We may use this data to improve our services, for example to train new models in the future.\\n  - We do NOT collect data on any of your messages or prompts unless you are using our hosted services (for example, if you are running your own model backends, this data will never be collected).\\n\\nBelow is our full Privacy Policy, which expands the overview in full detail.\\n\\n### What This Policy Covers\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:\\n\\n-   Our websites (including letta.ai, the Letta Discord server, and the repository github.com/cpacker/Letta);\\n-   Our applications (including the Python package, Discord Bot, and any other hosted services);\\n-   Our other Letta products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites;\\n\\nThroughout this Privacy Policy we\\'ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as \"Services.\"\\n\\nBelow we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.\\n\\n### Information We Collect\\n\\nWe only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.\\n\\nWe collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let\\'s go over the information that we collect.\\n\\n#### *Information You Provide to Us*\\n\\nIt\\'s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:\\n\\n-   **Basic account information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\\n-   **Public profile information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\\n-   **Credentials: **Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).\\n-   **Communications with us (hi there!):** You may also provide us with information when you post on GitHub, Discord, or message us through separate channels.\\n\\n#### *Information We Collect Automatically*\\n\\nWe also collect some information automatically:\\n\\n-   **Log information:** We collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.\\n-   **Usage information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services.  We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.\\n-   **Location information:** We may determine the location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.\\n-   **Stored information:** We may access information stored on your devices if you upload this information to our Services.\\n-   **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\\'s computer, and that the visitor\\'s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. We may use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services.\\n\\n#### *Information We Collect from Other Sources*\\n\\nWe may also get information about you from other sources. For example:\\n\\n-   **Third Party Login:** If you create or log in to our Services through another service (like Google) we\\'ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)\\n\\nThe information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.\\n\\nThird-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.\\n\\n### How and Why We Use Information\\n\\n#### *Purposes for Using Information*\\n\\nWe use information about you for the purposes listed below:\\n\\n-   **To provide our Services.** For example, to run a model on our hosted services to deliver a message to your client.\\n-   **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.\\n-   **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Letta and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.\\n-   **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.\\n-   **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications for our Services.\\n\\n#### *Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information*\\n\\nA note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:\\n\\n(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or\\n\\n(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or\\n\\n(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or\\n\\n(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or\\n\\n(5) You have given us your consent\\n\\n### Sharing Information\\n\\n#### *How We Share Information*\\n\\nWe share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.\\n\\n-   **Subsidiaries, independent contractors, and research partners:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, independent contractors, and/or research partners who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them. This includes the transfer of data collect on our Services to facilitate model training and refinement.\\n-   **Third-party vendors:** We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (such as intrastructure or model serving companies); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you.\\n-   **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.\\n-   **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Letta, third parties, or the public at large.\\n-   **Asset/IP transfers:** If any transfer of Letta assets were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.\\n-   **With your consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\\n-   **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.\\n-   **Published support requests:** If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.\\n\\n#### *Information Shared Publicly*\\n\\nInformation that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly.\\n\\nThat means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your \"Likes\" and comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views!\\n\\nFor example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven\\'t uploaded one, is your **G**lobally **R**ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar — get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and \"Likes\" that you make on other users\\' websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account.

You\\'ll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).\\n\\nIn the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:\\n\\n-   Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);\\n-   Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us or you may choose to voluntarily disclose your race or veteran status);\\n-   Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);\\n-   Application and user data (such as model data and user inputs used to render our Services)\\n-   Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);\\n-   Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);\\n-   Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).\\n\\nWe collect personal information for the purposes described in the \"How and Why We Use Information section\".

              " {'content': '# 🚀 How to Contribute to Letta\\n\\nThank you for investing time in contributing to our project! Here\\'s a guide to get you started.\\n\\n## 1. 🚀 Getting Started\\n\\n### 🍴 Fork the Repository\\n\\nFirst things first, let\\'s get you a personal copy of Letta to play with. Think of it as your very own playground. 🎪\\n\\n1. Head over to the Letta repository on GitHub.\\n2. In the upper-right corner, hit the \\'Fork\\' button.\\n\\n### 🚀 Clone the Repository\\n\\nNow, let\\'s bring your new playground to your local machine.\\n\\n```shell\\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/letta.git\\n```\\n\\n### 🧩 Install dependencies & configure environment\\n\\n#### Install uv and dependencies\\n\\nFirst, install uv using [the official instructions here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\\n\\nOnce uv is installed, navigate to the letta directory and install the Letta project with uv:\\n```shell\\ncd letta\\neval $(uv env activate)\\nuv sync --all-extras\\n```\\n#### Setup PostgreSQL environment (optional)\\n\\nIf you are planning to develop letta connected to PostgreSQL database, you need to take the following actions.\\nIf you are not planning to use PostgreSQL database, you can skip to the step which talks about [running letta](#running-letta-with-uv).\\n\\nAssuming you have a running PostgreSQL instance, first you need to create the user, database and ensure the pgvector\\nextension is ready. Here are sample steps for a case where user and database name is letta and assumes no password is set:\\n\\n```shell\\ncreateuser letta\\ncreatedb letta --owner=letta\\npsql -d letta -c \\'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector\\'\\n```\\nSetup the environment variable to tell letta code to contact PostgreSQL database:\\n```shell\\nexport LETTA_PG_URI=\"postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER:-letta}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-letta}@localhost:5432/${POSTGRES_DB:-letta}\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter this you need to prep the database with initial content. You can use alembic upgrade to populate the initial\\ncontents from template test data.\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic upgrade head\\n```\\n\\n#### Running letta with uv\\n\\nNow when you want to use `letta`, you can use `uv run` to run any letta command:\\n```shell\\nuv run letta run\\n```\\n\\n#### Installing pre-commit\\nWe recommend installing pre-commit to ensure proper formatting during development:\\n```\\nuv run pre-commit install\\nuv run pre-commit run --all-files\\n```\\nIf you don\\'t install pre-commit, you will need to run `uv run black .` before submitting a PR.\\n\\n## 2. 🛠️ Making Changes\\n\\n### 🌟 Create a Branch\\n\\nTime to put on your creative hat and make some magic happen. First, let\\'s create a new branch for your awesome changes. 🧙\\u200d♂️\\n\\n```shell\\ngit checkout -b feature/your-feature\\n```\\n\\n### ✏️ Make your Changes\\n\\nNow, the world is your oyster! Go ahead and craft your fabulous changes. 🎨\\n\\n\\n#### Handling Database Migrations\\nIf you are running Letta for the first time, your database will be automatically be setup. If you are updating Letta, you may need to run migrations. To run migrations, use the following command:\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic upgrade head\\n```\\n\\n#### Creating a new Database Migration\\nIf you have made changes to the database models, you will need to create a new migration. To create a new migration, use the following command:\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"Your migration message here\"\\n```\\n\\nVisit the [Alembic documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for more information on creating and running migrations.\\n\\n## 3. ✅ Testing\\n\\nBefore we hit the \\'Wow, I\\'m Done\\' button, let\\'s make sure everything works as expected. Run tests and make sure the existing ones don\\'t throw a fit. And if needed, create new tests. 🕵️\\n\\n### Run existing tests\\n\\nRunning tests:\\n```\\nuv run pytest -s tests\\n```\\n\\nRunning tests if you installed via pip:\\n```\\npytest -s tests\\n```\\n\\n### Creating new tests\\nIf you added a major feature change, please add new tests in the `tests/` directory.\\n\\n## 4. 🧩 Adding new dependencies\\nIf you need to add a new dependency to Letta, please add the package via `uv add <PACKAGE_NAME>`. This will update the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. If the dependency does not need to be installed by all users, make sure to mark the dependency as optional in the `pyproject.toml` file and if needed, create a new extra under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.\\n\\n## 5. 🚀 Submitting Changes\\n\\n### Check Formatting\\nPlease ensure your code is formatted correctly by running:\\n```\\nuv run black . -l 140\\n```\\n\\n### 🚀 Create a Pull Request\\n\\nYou\\'re almost there! It\\'s time to share your brilliance with the world. 🌍\\n\\n1. Visit [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta).\\n2. Click \"New Pull Request\" button.\\n3. Choose the base branch (`main`) and the compare branch (your feature branch).\\n4. Whip up a catchy title and describe your changes in the description. 🪄\\n\\n## 6. 🔍 Review and Approval\\n\\nThe maintainers will take a look and might suggest some cool upgrades or ask for more details. Once they give the thumbs up, your creation becomes part of Letta!\\n\\n## 7. 📜 Code of Conduct\\n\\nPlease be sure to follow the project\\'s Code of Conduct.\\n\\n## 8. 📫 Contact\\n\\nNeed help or just want to say hi? We\\'re here for you. Reach out through filing an issue on this GitHub repository or message us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9GEQrxmVyE).\\n\\nThanks for making Letta even more fantastic!\\n\\n## WIP - 🐋 Docker Development\\nIf you prefer to keep your resources isolated by developing purely in containers, you can start Letta in development with:\\n```shell\\ndocker compose -f compose.yaml -f development.compose.yml up\\n```\\nThis will volume mount your local codebase and reload the server on file changes.',\n",

Here\\'s a guide to get you started.\\n\\n## 1. 🚀 Getting Started\\n\\n### 🍴 Fork the Repository\\n\\nFirst things first, let\\'s get you a personal copy of Letta to play with. Think of it as your very own playground. 🎪\\n\\n1. Head over to the Letta repository on GitHub.\\n2. In the upper-right corner, hit the \\'Fork\\' button.\\n\\n### 🚀 Clone the Repository\\n\\nNow, let\\'s bring your new playground to your local machine.\\n\\n```shell\\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/letta.git\\n```\\n\\n### 🧩 Install dependencies & configure environment\\n\\n#### Install uv and dependencies\\n\\nFirst, install uv using [the official instructions here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\\n\\nOnce uv is installed, navigate to the letta directory and install the Letta project with uv:\\n```shell\\ncd letta\\neval $(uv env activate)\\nuv sync --all-extras\\n```\\n#### Setup PostgreSQL environment (optional)\\n\\nIf you are planning to develop letta connected to PostgreSQL database, you need to take the following actions.\\nIf you are not planning to use PostgreSQL database, you can skip to the step which talks about [running letta](#running-letta-with-uv).\\n\\nAssuming you have a running PostgreSQL instance, first you need to create the user, database and ensure the pgvector\\nextension is ready. Here are sample steps for a case where user and database name is letta and assumes no password is set:\\n\\n```shell\\ncreateuser letta\\ncreatedb letta --owner=letta\\npsql -d letta -c \\'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector\\'\\n```\\nSetup the environment variable to tell letta code to contact PostgreSQL database:\\n```shell\\nexport LETTA_PG_URI=\"postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER:-letta}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-letta}@localhost:5432/${POSTGRES_DB:-letta}\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter this you need to prep the database with initial content. You can use alembic upgrade to populate the initial\\ncontents from template test data.\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic upgrade head\\n```\\n\\n#### Running letta with uv\\n\\nNow when you want to use `letta`, you can use `uv run` to run any letta command:\\n```shell\\nuv run letta run\\n```\\n\\n#### Installing pre-commit\\nWe recommend installing pre-commit to ensure proper formatting during development:\\n```\\nuv run pre-commit install\\nuv run pre-commit run --all-files\\n```\\nIf you don\\'t install pre-commit, you will need to run `uv run black .` before submitting a PR.\\n\\n## 2. 🛠️ Making Changes\\n\\n### 🌟 Create a Branch\\n\\nTime to put on your creative hat and make some magic happen. First, let\\'s create a new branch for your awesome changes. 🧙\\u200d♂️\\n\\n```shell\\ngit checkout -b feature/your-feature\\n```\\n\\n### ✏️ Make your Changes\\n\\nNow, the world is your oyster! Go ahead and craft your fabulous changes. 🎨\\n\\n\\n#### Handling Database Migrations\\nIf you are running Letta for the first time, your database will be automatically be setup. If you are updating Letta, you may need to run migrations. To run migrations, use the following command:\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic upgrade head\\n```\\n\\n#### Creating a new Database Migration\\nIf you have made changes to the database models, you will need to create a new migration. To create a new migration, use the following command:\\n```shell\\nuv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"Your migration message here\"\\n```\\n\\nVisit the [Alembic documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for more information on creating and running migrations.\\n\\n## 3. ✅ Testing\\n\\nBefore we hit the \\'Wow, I\\'m Done\\' button, let\\'s make sure everything works as expected. Run tests and make sure the existing ones don\\'t throw a fit. And if needed, create new tests. 🕵️\\n\\n### Run existing tests\\n\\nRunning tests:\\n```\\nuv run pytest -s tests\\n```\\n\\nRunning tests if you installed via pip:\\n```\\npytest -s tests\\n```\\n\\n### Creating new tests\\nIf you added a major feature change, please add new tests in the `tests/` directory.\\n\\n## 4. 🧩 Adding new dependencies\\nIf you need to add a new dependency to Letta, please add the package via `uv add <PACKAGE_NAME>`. This will update the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. If the dependency does not need to be installed by all users, make sure to mark the dependency as optional in the `pyproject.toml` file and if needed, create a new extra under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.\\n\\n## 5. 🚀 Submitting Changes\\n\\n### Check Formatting\\nPlease ensure your code is formatted correctly by running:\\n```\\nuv run black . -l 140\\n```\\n\\n### 🚀 Create a Pull Request\\n\\nYou\\'re almost there! It\\'s time to share your brilliance with the world. 🌍\\n\\n1. Visit [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta).\\n2. Click \"New Pull Request\" button.\\n3. Choose the base branch (`main`) and the compare branch (your feature branch).\\n4. Whip up a catchy title and describe your changes in the description. 🪄\\n\\n## 6. 🔍 Review and Approval\\n\\nThe maintainers will take a look and might suggest some cool upgrades or ask for more details. Once they give the thumbs up, your creation becomes part of Letta!\\n\\n## 7. 📜 Code of Conduct\\n\\nPlease be sure to follow the project\\'s Code of Conduct.\\n\\n## 8. 📫 Contact\\n\\nNeed help or just want to say hi? We\\'re here for you. Reach out through filing an issue on this GitHub repository or message us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9GEQrxmVyE).\\n\\nThanks for making Letta even more fantastic!\\n\\n## WIP - 🐋 Docker Development\\nIf you prefer to keep your resources isolated by developing purely in containers, you can start Letta in development with:\\n```shell\\ndocker compose -f compose.yaml -f development.compose.yml up\\n```\\nThis will volume mount your local codebase and reload the server on file changes.',\n",

              " {'content': '# Step Completion Webhook\\n\\nThis feature allows you to receive webhook notifications whenever an agent step completes in the Letta agent loop.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe webhook service integrates with Letta\\'s execution architecture in two ways:\\n\\n### 1. With Temporal (Recommended)\\n\\nWhen using Temporal for agent workflows, webhook calls are wrapped as Temporal activities, providing:\\n- Built-in retry logic with configurable timeouts\\n- Full observability in Temporal UI\\n- Durability guarantees\\n- Consistent error handling\\n- Activity history and replay capability\\n\\nWebhooks are triggered after the `create_step` activity completes in the Temporal workflow.\\n\\n### 2. Without Temporal (Direct Execution)\\n\\nFor direct agent execution (non-Temporal), webhooks are called directly from the `StepManager` service methods:\\n- `update_step_success_async()` - When step completes successfully\\n- `update_step_error_async()` - When step fails with an error\\n- `update_step_cancelled_async()` - When step is cancelled\\n\\nWebhooks are sent after the step status is committed to the database.\\n\\n### Common Behavior\\n\\nIn **both** cases:\\n- ✅ Webhook failures do not prevent step completion\\n- ✅ Step is always marked as complete in the database first\\n- ✅ Webhook delivery is logged for debugging\\n- ✅ Same authentication and payload format\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nSet the following environment variables to enable webhook notifications:\\n\\n### Required\\n\\n- **`STEP_COMPLETE_WEBHOOK`**: The URL endpoint that will receive POST requests when steps complete.\\n  - Example: `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/step-complete`\\n\\n### Optional\\n\\n- **`STEP_COMPLETE_KEY`**: A secret key used for authentication.\\n  - When set, the webhook service will include this in an `Authorization` header as `Bearer {key}`\\n  - Example: `your-secret-webhook-key-12345`\\n\\n## Webhook Payload\\n\\nWhen a step completes, the webhook service will send a POST request with the following JSON payload:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"step_id\": \"step-01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nIf `STEP_COMPLETE_KEY` is configured, requests will include an Authorization header:\\n\\n```\\nAuthorization: Bearer your-secret-webhook-key-12345\\n```\\n\\nYour webhook endpoint should validate this key to ensure requests are coming from your Letta instance.\\n\\n## Example Webhook Endpoint\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple example of a webhook endpoint (using FastAPI):\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nimport os\\n\\napp = FastAPI()\\n\\nclass StepCompletePayload(BaseModel):\\n    step_id: str\\n\\nWEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv(\"STEP_COMPLETE_KEY\")\\n\\n@app.post(\"/api/webhooks/step-complete\")\\nasync def handle_step_complete(\\n    payload: StepCompletePayload,\\n    authorization: str = Header(None)\\n):\\n    # Validate the webhook key\\n    if WEBHOOK_SECRET:\\n        if not authorization or not authorization.startswith(\"Bearer \"):\\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Missing authorization\")\\n\\n        token = authorization.replace(\"Bearer \", \"\")\\n        if token != WEBHOOK_SECRET:\\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid authorization\")\\n\\n    # Process the step completion\\n    print(f\"Step completed: {payload.step_id}\")\\n\\n    # You can now:\\n    # - Log the step completion\\n    # - Trigger downstream processes\\n    # - Update your application state\\n    # - Send notifications\\n\\n    return {\"status\": \"success\"}\\n```\\n\\n## Usage Example\\n\\n```bash\\n# Set environment variables\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_WEBHOOK=\"https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/step-complete\"\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_KEY=\"your-secret-webhook-key-12345\"\\n\\n# Start your Letta server\\npython -m letta.server\\n```\\n\\n## When Webhooks Are Sent\\n\\nWebhooks are triggered when a step reaches a terminal state:\\n\\n1. **Success** - Step completed successfully (`StepStatus.SUCCESS`)\\n2. **Error** - Step failed with an error (`StepStatus.FAILED`)\\n3. **Cancelled** - Step was cancelled (`StepStatus.CANCELLED`)\\n\\nAll three states trigger the webhook with the same payload containing just the `step_id`.\\n\\n## Behavior\\n\\n- **No webhook URL configured**: The service will skip sending notifications (logged at debug level)\\n- **Webhook call succeeds**: Returns status 200-299, logged at info level\\n- **Webhook timeout**: Returns error, logged at warning level (does not fail the step)\\n- **HTTP error**: Returns non-2xx status, logged at warning level (does not fail the step)\\n- **Other errors**: Logged at error level (does not fail the step)\\n\\n**Important**: Webhook failures do not prevent step completion. The step will be marked as complete in the database regardless of webhook delivery status. This ensures system reliability - your webhook endpoint being down will not block agent execution.\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTo test the webhook functionality:\\n\\n1. Set up a webhook endpoint (you can use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) for testing)\\n2. Configure the environment variables\\n3. Run an agent and observe webhook calls when steps complete\\n\\n```bash\\n# Example using webhook.site\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_WEBHOOK=\"https://webhook.site/your-unique-url\"\\nexport STEP_COMPLETE_KEY=\"test-key-123\"\\n\\n# Run tests\\npython -m pytest apps/core/letta/services/webhook_service_test.py -v\\n```\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\nThe webhook notification is sent after:\\n1. The step is persisted to the database\\n2. Step metrics are recorded\\n\\nThis ensures that the step data is fully committed before external systems are notified.\\n\\n### Temporal Integration\\n\\nWhen using Temporal, the webhook call is executed as a separate activity (`send_step_complete_webhook`) with the following configuration:\\n\\n- **Start-to-close timeout**: 15 seconds\\n- **Schedule-to-close timeout**: 30 seconds\\n- **Retry behavior**: Wrapped in try-catch to prevent workflow failure on webhook errors\\n\\nThis allows you to monitor webhook delivery in the Temporal UI and get detailed visibility into any failures.\\n\\n### File Locations\\n\\n**Core Service:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/services/webhook_service.py` - HTTP client for webhook delivery\\n\\n**Temporal Integration:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/agents/temporal/activities/send_webhook.py` - Temporal activity wrapper\\n- `apps/core/letta/agents/temporal/temporal_agent_workflow.py` - Workflow integration\\n- `apps/core/letta/agents/temporal/constants.py` - Timeout constants\\n\\n**Non-Temporal Integration:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/services/step_manager.py` - Direct calls in update_step_* methods\\n\\n**Tests:**\\n- `apps/core/letta/services/webhook_service_test.py` - Unit tests',\n",
